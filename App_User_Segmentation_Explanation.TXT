                                 APP_USER_SEGMENTATION (Using Python)

App user segmentation is the task of grouping users based on how they engage with the app. 
It helps find retained users, find the user segment for a marketing campaign, and solve many other 
business problems where you need to search for users based on similar characteristics.

In the problem of app user segmentation, we need to group users based on how they engage with the app. 
So to solve this problem, we need to have data about the users based on how they engage with the app.

I found a dataset containing data about how users who use an app daily and the users who have 
uninstalled the app engaged with the app. This data can be used to group users to find the retained and 
churn users.
