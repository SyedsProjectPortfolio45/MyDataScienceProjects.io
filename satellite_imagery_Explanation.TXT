                                SATELLITE_IMAGERY_ANALYSIS (Using Python)

Satellite images are images of the Earth that are collected by the imaging satellites which are 
operated by the government and businesses all around the world.

I will walk you through a satellite imagery analysis task over the Sundarbans forest in India.

info:
'''The Sundarbans are one of the largest mangrove areas in the delta formed by the confluence of the 
Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal. The Sundarbans Forest stretches approximately 
10,000 km sq across India and Bangladesh, 40% of which is found in India and is home to many rare and 
globally threatened wildlife. '''

Satellite Imagery Analysis with Python
In this task, I will be using a very small part of the Sundarbans region for the task of analyzing 
satellite imagery with Python. I’ll be using a small portion of the Sundarbans satellite data that is 
acquired using the Sentinel-2 satellite.

The dataset I am using is in the form of 954×298 pixels, with 12 bands with a spectral resolution 
varying from 10 to 60 meters.
