                                NAMED_ENTITY_RECOGNITION (Using Python and NLP)

Named Entity means anything that is a real-world object such as a person, a place, any organisation, 
any product which has a name. For example – “My name is Syed, and I am a Data Science Intern”. In 
this sentence the name “Syed”, the field or subject “Data Science” and the profession “Intern” are 
named entities.

In Machine Learning Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing to identify 
the named entities in a certain piece of text.

Have you ever used software known as Grammarly? It identifies all the incorrect spellings and 
punctuations in the text and corrects it. But it does not do anything with the named entities, as it is 
also using the same technique.
